Exercise: 
Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S. 
For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple","bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"

How to run? 
Run longest_subsequence2.py file passing a string and a list arguments to it like the ones in example.

Example: 
./longest_subsequence2.py 'abppplee' -l 'able' 'ale' 'apple' 'bale' 'kangaroo'
